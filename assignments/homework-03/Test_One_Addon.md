#Multi

1.	Multitasking- when the computer allows you to perform more than one task at a time. Example is you typing a work document and listening to music at the same time.
2.	Multiprogramming- when several programs are allowed to run at the same time on the same processor. For example, running google chrome and visual studios.
3.	Multiprocessing-using two or more central processing units within a single computer. For example, a process using threads on two individually installed I7 cpus
4.	Multithreaded- when a single process can have multiple code segments running concurrently with that process. For a process has code to calculate data and receive input and it runs both concurrently on the same cpu.


##Review questions from chapter 3
1.	An instruction trace is a tracing mechanism that locates a buffer, captures MTE information and writes branch trace records 
2.	System initialization, execution of a process creation system call, a user request and initializing a batch job lead to the creation of a process.
3.	To preempt a process is to temporarily interrupt the task being carried out by the computer
4.	Swapping is moving a blocked process from main memory to the secondary memory

5.	It has the two blocks to deal with the two blocked states that can occur.

6.	Four characteristics are, the process isnâ€™t immediately available to be executed, the process may or may not be waiting for an event, the process was placed in a suspended state by its parent process itself or the operating system and the process may not be removed from this state until the agent explicitly orders the removal
7.	Process identification, processor state information and process control information.
8.	The two modes are needed because they offer unrestricted access to the hardware or recovering from crashes easily. The two are needed to offer the correct amount of freedom or restriction to a program or process where needed
9.	Interrupts are used to signal the completion of an I/O to obviate the need for device polling they are also hardware based. Traps are software generated interrupts that can be used to call operating system routines or to catch arithmetic errors
10.	Three examples of interrupts are maskable interrupts, non maskable interrupts, and normal interrupts.
11.	A process switch is when the processor switches from one thread process to another while a mode switch us when the cpu changes privilege levels
